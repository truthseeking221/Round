# Round — Mini App UI Specification (English)

Execution plan (scope + gates): `MASTER_PLAN.md`

This file is **UI-only**. Source of truth remains `docs/BUILD_GUIDE.md` (Part 3 — BOT & MINI APP (UI)).

## 2) Mini App (React) — Screens & Flows (English Copy)

### 2.1 Routes
- `/` Home (Group Landing)
- `/circle/:circle_id` Circle Dashboard
- `/circle/:circle_id/join` Join Flow
- `/circle/:circle_id/auction` Auction Flow (Commit/Reveal)
- `/circle/:circle_id/withdraw` Withdraw Screen

Tech:
- React + Vite + TS
- shadcn/ui
- TonConnect UI
- Telegram WebApp SDK (initData + theme + close)

---

## 3) Global UI Copy Rules (English)
1) Always show on-chain timestamps (due_at, grace_end_at, commit_end_at, reveal_end_at).
2) While status is `Active`:
   - Only allow withdrawing **Withdrawable Now** (mode=1), if `withdrawable > 0`.
   - Do NOT allow withdrawing collateral, prefund, credit, future_locked, or vesting during Active.
3) While status is `Recruiting`:
   - If user has deposits: show **Exit & Refund** (mode=3).
4) When status is `Terminated / Completed / EmergencyStop`:
   - Show **Withdraw All** (mode=2).
5) Auction explanation must always be present and short:
   - never say "interest rate"
   - always say "How much do you want to receive?"

---

### S11 — Withdraw (Mode-based)
Title: `Withdraw`
Detect:
- status + mode availability
Mode=1 (Active):
- Label: `Withdrawable Now`
- Button: `Withdraw Now`
Mode=2 (Completed/Terminated/EmergencyStop):
- Label: `Withdraw All`
- Button: `Withdraw All`
Mode=3 (Recruiting):
- Label: `Exit & Refund`
- Button: `Exit & Refund`

Confirmation modal copy (important):
- Active: `This will withdraw only your Withdrawable Now amount. Other funds remain locked by rules.`
- Recruiting: `This will exit the circle and refund your deposits. You will no longer be a participant.`
- Terminated/Completed: `This will withdraw all remaining balances.`

---

## 5) TonConnect Implementation Notes
- Always require wallet connected before sending any tx.
- Store (payoutWanted, salt) in localStorage for reveal.
- If localStorage missing (user cleared data):
  - show: `You need your saved bid data to reveal. Please contact support if you lost it.` (MVP reality)
  - (Optional P1) store encrypted salt server-side, but that adds custody-like responsibility.

---

## 6) UX Improvements (English)
### 6.1 Reduce fear: "funds safety banner"
On every Circle screen:
> Funds are held by a smart contract. The app cannot move your funds outside the rules.

### 6.2 Winner clarity (avoid disputes)
Always show 3 lines:
- Withdrawable Now
- Vesting Locked
- Locked for Future Payments

### 6.3 No harassment defaults
Use neutral reminders:
- "Payment is due"
- "Grace period is ending"
Avoid:
- "debtor", "shame", "punishment"
